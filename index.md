## Situation in Present Day

Following World War II, the Korean Peninsula was divided into a Northern and Southern half which eventually became the North and South Koreas we know today. The Korean war further drove a wedge between the two Koreas and the situation remains tense to the present day.

> The division of Korea between North and South Korea was the result of the Allied victory in World War II in 1945, ending the Empire of Japan's 35-year rule of Korea. The United States and the Soviet Union occupied the country, with the boundary between their zones of control along the 38th parallel. With the onset of the Cold War, negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union failed to lead to an independent, unified Korea. In 1948, UN-supervised elections were held in the US-occupied south only. This led to the establishment of the Republic of Korea in South Korea, which was promptly followed by the establishment of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in North Korea. The United States supported the South, and the Soviet Union supported the North, and each government claimed sovereignty over the whole Korean peninsula. The Korean War (1950–1953) left the two Koreas separated by the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) in the later part of the Cold War and beyond.

## Korean War

> The Korean War (in South Korean Hangul: 한국전쟁; Hanja: 韓國戰爭; RR: Hanguk Jeonjaeng, "Korean War"; in North Korean Chosŏn'gŭl: 조국해방전쟁; Hancha: 祖國解放戰爭; MR: Choguk haebang chǒnjaeng, "Fatherland Liberation War"; 25 June 1950 – 27 July 1953) began when North Korea invaded South Korea. The United Nations, with the United States as the principal force, came to the aid of South Korea. China came to the aid of North Korea, and the Soviet Union gave some assistance.

# Aim

At the time of undertaking this project, the likelihood of a war between South Korea and North Korea seems to be escalating. With this in mind, we would like to investigate the historical trends in the media leading up to "similar" conflicts in history and compare this with the trends in the media today relating to a renewed South-North conflict in Korea.

# Methodology

We proceeded in the following manner:

1. Define Case Studies of "Similar Conflicts" to be investigate
2. Pick Media Variables to Investigate
3. Collect Data
4. Analyse Data with Python
